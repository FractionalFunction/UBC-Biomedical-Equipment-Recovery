				<h1>About This Project</h1>
			</div>
            
			<h3>We don’t just volunteer</h3>
			<h3>We volunteer with our hearts</h3>
			<p>The UBC Biomedical Equipment Recovery Project is led by a group of enthusiastic SWC IB Grad 2017 students who contribute their precious time toward building a healthy learning environment for other students around the world. We understand that we are privileged to be part of the Sir Winston Churchill Secondary learning environment, and thus strive to create equal environment by mailing the “outdated” UBC books and medical equipment to schools that have not yet acquired them.</p>  
			<h3>From an idea to an organization</h3>
			<p>This organization is inspired and supported by our IB supervisor, Geoff Gabbott. His personal connection with UBC made this project a reality.  However, everything thereafter is organized by IB volunteers, who formed divisions such as books, medical equipment, and marketing. Furthermore, each division is supervised by an IB leader, whose dedication was enormous and admirable. </p>
